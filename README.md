Saiku-fullscreen
================

A Saiku UI Fullscreen plugin. For when you would like to show tables and graphs for an audience in a presentation.

Some of the rendering plugins I've made, makes best use of large screen real estate. This is a fairly simple plugin utilizing the [fullscreen API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Using_full_screen_mode).

This is a very early release. It is not done yet. Do not install and expect production quality.

The plugin should be improved by having som css rules, to increase font sizes in some of the visualizations. How to add fullscreen pseudo classes is documentet in before mentioned link.

I have been thinkin of implementing key press detection of arrow keys, so one could walk through the open tabs in Saiku. Then one could prepare a presentation, where the tabs became sort of "slides".
